"Using the language of Markdown, write a short report about your experience with these data portals"
themes: 

**data.gov**
found "janitorial" but not "janitor" (dataset should be able to be found under both queries)
http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/services-annual-survey

searched "university acceptance" and filtered by Dataset type, choosing geospatial
could filter by location, choosing California

**Open Data Network**


**data.cityofpaloalto.org**


**Federal Electtion Commission**


**data.gov.uk**



Trying to get fancy with Markdown, I created a table of XX (below):

| data.gov | Open Data Network | data.cityofpaloalto | FEC | data.gov.uk
---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- 
Content from cell 1 | X | X | X | X | X
