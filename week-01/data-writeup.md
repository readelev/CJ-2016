"Using the language of Markdown, write a short report about your experience with these data portals"

Same theme, looking into wage rates of janitorial staff (something related to Beaureau of Labor Stats?)

Also interested in:
* OSHA complaints by region
* Medicaid downgrades (any data)

**data.gov**

*Pros:*

I was really able to narrow search...searched "university acceptance" and filtered by Dataset type, choosing geospatial
could filter by location, choosing California :grinning:

*Cons:*

found "janitorial" but not "janitor" (dataset should be able to be found under both queries)

**Open Data Network**

*Pros:*

Open Data Network has this handy feature where the show you '<Sample Values>' in each column, which made it really easy to understand the level of detail / usability in each dataset.

*Cons:*

Had the same issue (as data.gov) of not including search results for '<janitor>' within results for '<janitorial>'. Also, Open Data Network tended to have more datasets related to financials/budgets than to labor statistics or datasets more traditionally difficult to find.

I was also frusterated by how little I could refine my search on Open Data Network. I could only choose between "Publishers" or "Catagories", both of which too limited

**Federal Electtion Commission**

*Pros:*

RSS feed option

*Cons:*

The layout of the FEC page takes me back to the 90's where I have to scroll through undifferentiated results akin to what a Yahoo search would produce and then fill in bubbles before downloading my data (see images below):

Trying to get fancy with Markdown, I created a table of XX (below). Portals are ranked on a scale of 1 - 5 (with 5 being the best) for each of 6 factors:

| data.gov | Open Data Network | data.cityofpaloalto | FEC | data.gov.uk
---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- 
Types of data | X | X | X | X | X
Ability to refine search | X | X | X | X | X
