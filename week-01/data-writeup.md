"Using the language of Markdown, write a short report about your experience with these data portals"

Same theme, looking into wage rates of janitorial staff (something related to Beaureau of Labor Stats?)

Also interested in:
* OSHA complaints by region
* Medicaid downgrades (any data)

**data.gov**


found "janitorial" but not "janitor" (dataset should be able to be found under both queries)
http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/services-annual-survey

searched "university acceptance" and filtered by Dataset type, choosing geospatial
could filter by location, choosing California :grinning:

**Open Data Network**

same issue of not including results for "janitor" in results for "janitorial"

did not include BL stats that data.gov had

wayyyyyy too little to "refine by", could only choose between "Publishers" or "Catagories", both of which too limited

Trying to get fancy with Markdown, I created a table of XX (below):

| data.gov | Open Data Network | data.cityofpaloalto | FEC | data.gov.uk
