##1. Create a page that lists the title of every recall in 2016, with a clickable link to the official URL, and a photo of the recalled product.

[Here's my app.py script](https://github.com/readelev/cj-2016/blob/master/flask-recalls-practice/homework/app.py) along with:
* a [datafoo script](https://github.com/readelev/cj-2016/blob/master/flask-recalls-practice/homework/datafoo.py)
* a [static folder](https://github.com/readelev/cj-2016/tree/master/flask-recalls-practice/homework/static)
* a [folder for templates](https://github.com/readelev/cj-2016/tree/master/flask-recalls-practice/homework/templates)

The site looks something like this:
