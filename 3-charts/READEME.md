*(without coffee this morning)*

# Homework (due May 4): In your cj-2016 repo, create a folder named 3-charts.

Here: [https://github.com/readelev/cj-2016/tree/master/3-charts](https://github.com/readelev/cj-2016/tree/master/3-charts)

## 1. Make a line chart comparing the stock performance of various tech companies

Uses this data (https://github.com/datademofun/matplotlibsampler/tree/master/data/stocks)

**NOTE:** I was completely wooed by Randal Olson's [beautiful line plot tuturial](http://www.randalolson.com/2014/06/28/how-to-make-beautiful-data-visualizations-in-python-with-matplotlib/), so I created a [single CSV with the complied close values](https://github.com/readelev/cj-2016/tree/master/3-charts/data/STOCKS.csv) from all six stocks.

[This script](https://github.com/readelev/cj-2016/tree/master/3-charts/stocks-simple.py) makes this:

## 2. A scatterplot showing the relationship between two independent variables

[This script](https://github.com/readelev/cj-2016/tree/master/3-charts/scatter.py) makes this:

## 3. A stacked bar chart with categorical variables. An example: Number of twitter followers by congressional party and gender

[This script](https://github.com/readelev/cj-2016/tree/master/3-charts/tweets.py) makes this:
