# Homework

## Due Wednesday, 2016-04-13 23:59

(In progress...)

#1. Find the first press briefing in which ISIS or ISIL were mentioned in a White House press briefing

First step is to download all the press briefings from President Obama's presidency (January 2011 to today) and save them as html files. [This script](https://github.com/readelev/cj-2016/tree/master/week-03/wh-briefings-word-scrape.py) does that.

Next step

#2. Count the number of mentions (including all variations in spelling) of ISIS, ISIL, Osama bin Laden, and Al-Qaeda within the published White House press briefings

#3. List the name of every executed Texas inmate who did not mention religion in their final words: http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/death_row/dr_executed_offenders.html

#4. For the 2015 session of the Supreme Court, list the Supreme Court justices in descending order of number of times they talked, according to the oral transcripts: http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcript/2015
